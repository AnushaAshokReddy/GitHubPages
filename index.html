	<h1>LearningApi Introduction</h1>
	<p>I'm best known as the horrible cop from <em>A Touch of Evil</em> Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p>Learning API is Machine Learning Foundation of a set of ML libraries fully implemented as .NET Standard library. It provides a unique processing API for Machine Learning solutions. Because it is implemented fully in .NET, developers do not have to bridge .NET and Python or other popular ML frameworks. It has been developed in cooperation with daenet GmBh and Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.</p>

	<p>LearningAPI already has interfaces pre declared which we can easily access, understand and use in our project. <br> For example IAlgorithm,IScore, IResult, IPipeline module.</P>
IMAGE 2 
	<p> A small demo of the code is as followed : </p>
	IMAGE 3
	<P> LearningAPI is a foundation of Machine Learning algorithms, which can run in the pipeline of modules compatible to each other. This concept allows using of conceptually different algorithms in the same API, which consists of a chain of modules. One pipeline module is defined as implementation of interface IPipeline.</p>

<br> The format for IPipeline : 
<br> 
		<pre>
		<code>
     public interface IPipelineModule
    {

    }

    public interface IPipelineModule<TIN, TOUT> : IPipelineModule
    {
        TOUT Run(TIN data, IContext ctx);
    }
    </pre>
		</code>
		
<p> The module receives an input TIN and context information. Usually TIN is set of data, which results as output of th eprevious module. Typically, first module in the pipeline is responsibe to provide learning data and last module in the pipeline is usually algorithm.
<br> Following example illustrates how setup the learning pipeline:
<br> 
<pre>
<code>
public void SimpleSequenceTest()
        {
            LearningApi api = new LearningApi();
            api.UseActionModule<object, double[][]>((notUsed, ctx) =>
            {
                const int maxSamples = 10000;
                ctx.DataDescriptor = getDescriptor();
                double[][] data = new double[maxSamples][];

                //
                // We generate following input vectors: 
                // IN Val - Expected OUT Val 
                // 1 - 0
                // 2 - 0,
                // ...
                // maxSamples / 2     - 1,
                // maxSamples / 2 + 1 - 1,
                // maxSamples / 2 + 2 - 1,


                for (int i = 0; i < maxSamples; i++)
                {
                    data[i] = new double[2];
                    data[i][0] = i;
                    data[i][1] = (i > (maxSamples / 2)) ? 1 : 0;
                }

                return data;
            });

            api.UsePerceptron(0.02, 10000);

            IScore score = api.Run() as IScore;

            double[][] testData = new double[4][];
            testData[0] = new double[] { 2.0, 0.0 };
            testData[1] = new double[] { 2000.0, 0.0 };
            testData[2] = new double[] { 6000.0, 0.0 };
            testData[3] = new double[] { 5001, 0.0 };

            var result = api.Algorithm.Predict(testData, api.Context) as PerceptronResult;

            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[0] == 0);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[1] == 0);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[2] == 1);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[3] == 1);
        }
        
         private DataDescriptor getDescriptor()
        {
            DataDescriptor desc = new DataDescriptor();
            desc.Features = new LearningFoundation.DataMappers.Column[1];
            desc.Features[0] = new LearningFoundation.DataMappers.Column()
            {
                Id = 0,
                Name = "X",
                Type = LearningFoundation.DataMappers.ColumnType.NUMERIC,
                Index = 0,
            };

            desc.LabelIndex = 1;

            return desc;
        }
</pre>
		</code>
</p>
<p>The code shown above setups the pipeline of two modules.</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>First one is so called action module, which defines the custom code to be executed.</li>
  <li>Second module is setup by following line: <br> api.UsePerceptron(0.02, 10000); </li>
</ul> 
<p>It injects the perceptron algorithm in the pipeline.
<br> Execution of the pipeline is started with following code:
<br>
<code> IScore score = api.Run() as IScore; </code>
<br> When the pipeline starts, modules are executed in the sequenceordered as they are added to the pipeline. In this case, first action module will be executed and then perceptron algorithm. After running of the pipeline model is trained. Next common step in Machine Learning applications is called evaluation of the model. Following code in previous example shows how to evaluation (predict) the model:
<br> 
<pre>
<code>
double[][] testData = new double[4][];
            testData[0] = new double[] { 2.0, 0.0 };
            testData[1] = new double[] { 2000.0, 0.0 };
            testData[2] = new double[] { 6000.0, 0.0 };
            testData[3] = new double[] { 5001, 0.0 };

            var result = api.Algorithm.Predict(testData, api.Context) as PerceptronResult;

            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[0] == 0);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[1] == 0);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[2] == 1);
            Assert.True(result.PredictedValues[3] == 1);

</pre>
</code>

<h1>Supported Modules and Algorithms</h1>

<p>All the supported Modules and Algorithms are listed in an excel sheet. Also, the information about the documentation and coding source files availabiliy in the LearningApi repository can be found here.
<br> <a href="https://github.com/UniversityOfAppliedSciencesFrankfurt/LearningApi/blob/master/LearningApi/src/AlgorithmsModules%20_list.xlsx">SupportedModules and Algorithms list...</a></p>

<h1>The LearningApi Concept</h1>
<p>Open the class ‘LearningApiAlgorithm.cs’ and implement the IAlgorithm in the code which is taken from Learning Api NuGet package. IAlgorithm is in the library and it has a separate structure which we have to use in the project. 
<br>The structure of IAlgorithm has 2 phases:
<ol>
  <li>IScore – Iscore is used to set and get the final result of the algorithm and store it. We Use IScore for the PREDICT phase - This is the final phase where we get the perfect output for the input provided by the user on the basis of the algorithm we give.In this prediction logic should be written as shown in  screenshot 6.
</li>
  <li>IResult – This is used to set and get the values of the variables used in the project. We use IResult in RUN ans TRAIN methods.</li>
</ol>
<br>RUN – This is the evaluation part where the random data will be given to our system to test whether the correct output is being displayed after the training session. Here call TRAIN method internally.
<br>TRAIN – Here we will train  the system with our specific set of data I.e input and the output as in how to function. Algorithm of the function is written in Train as shown in screenshot5.</p>



<h1>How to use LearningApi for Modules and Algorithms</h1>

<p>Learning API is Machine Learning Foundation of a set of ML libraries fully implemented as .NET Standard library. It provides a unique processing API for Machine Learning solutions. Because it is implemented fully in .NET, developers do not have to bridge .NET and Python or other popular ML frameworks. It has been developed in cooperation with daenet GmbH and Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.
<br> Here the process/ steps to create the solution for an algorithm using different unit test methods has been explained. There are few points to know before starting to create the solution (1) SOLUTION is a folder of collection of projects (in our case, LearningApiAlgorithm and UnitTest1), (2) PROJECT is a collection of classes and the different types of projects include Console Application, Class Library, Unit Test, Windows from Applications, (3) NUGET PACKAGE NuGet is a free and open source package manager designed for the Microsoft development platform (formerly known as NuPack). NuGet is distributed as a Visual Studio extension. This package contains pre-defined functions which are readily available to use in our project.</p>
